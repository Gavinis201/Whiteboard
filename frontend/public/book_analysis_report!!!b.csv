"Flaming Grenade (Fountains of Power, #1), The",Marcus Williams,Fantasy Adventure,5,"The Flaming Grenade is the first book in the Fountains of Power series by Marcus Williams. The story takes place in Japan during the 13th century, and follows the journey of a samurai who is tasked with delivering a message to the Emperor Kameyama. The samurai rides his horse for two days under the orders of the Shogun, and finally arrives at the monastery at Ise Jingū in Mie Prefecture.

Upon arrival, the samurai is met by a monk who refuses to let him enter, citing that the Emperor is not receiving visitors. The samurai becomes enraged and threatens to use violence, but the monk remains calm and does not respond.

The samurai is then escorted to a room where he meets Myōkū, a former warrior who has joined the priesthood. Myōkū explains that he will speak with the Emperor on the samurai's behalf.

The samurai is led through the monastery, and as they walk, he notices that the monks avoid eye contact with him. He becomes increasingly agitated and begins to draw his sword, but is stopped by Myōkū.

The two men enter a room where the Emperor is waiting, and the samurai delivers his message. The Emperor listens intently, and after a moment of silence, he dismisses the samurai.

The samurai is escorted back to his horse, and as he mounts, he reflects on the encounter. He realizes that he has learned a valuable lesson about the power of patience and dialogue, and he vows to use these skills in the future.
